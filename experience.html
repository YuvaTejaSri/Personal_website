            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>During my diverse internship journey, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in multiple domains, gaining extensive hands-on experience and enhancing my skill set. At Bharat Tech, as an AI/ML Intern, I contributed to the development and implementation of machine learning algorithms and AI solutions, focusing on training models and creating data splits to facilitate their development and evaluation. My time at Pie Infocomm allowed me to delve into Python and Java software development, where I worked on various projects, enhancing my problem-solving skills and building robust, scalable solutions.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, as a Cyber Security Intern at EduSkills in Palo Alto, CA, I actively monitored security alerts, analyzed logs, and participated in incident response to mitigate threats. I conducted vulnerability assessments, applied security patches, and implemented protocols to safeguard cloud infrastructure. In addition to these technical roles, my position as a Campus Manager at Talent Battle enabled me to spearhead initiatives to engage and empower students in their professional development, coordinating campus recruitment drives and promotional events. Each of these experiences has significantly contributed to my growth and expertise, preparing me to tackle future challenges in the tech industry.</p>
